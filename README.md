- To create new file:

`for Windows CMD`
  ```
    mkdir lib
    type nul > lib\event_manager.rb
  ```
`for Windows Linux`
  ```
    mkdir lib
    touch lib\event_manager.rb
  ```
- to read file:
    - go to file

    - run command to read csv file
  ```
    ruby lib\event_manager.rb
  ```
- to confirm that you are in the right directory and enter the following command:
  ```
    curl -o event_attendees.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/ruby/files_and_serialization/event_attendees.csv
  ```
- so as not to disclose the secret key:
    - create file `secret.key`;
    - write API key inside `secret.key`;
    - create `.gitignore` file and write inside 
  ```
    secret.key
  ```
    to hide your key safely and don't pass to GitHub repo;

    - save the value in variable `civic_info.key`
  ```
    civic_info.key = File.read('secret.key').strip
  ```
